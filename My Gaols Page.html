	<p>My current goal is to get a degree in Wake Technical Community College. With my education I plan to get the best IT job I can get with my experience, whick is not much at the moment, but I plan to change that really soon. With that IT job, I hope to fund my own independant game development project. The project will take a lot of knowlege and a team. My long term goal is to become successful enough to give back to my community where I spent half of my childhood in, Northern Ohio. I plan to do this by opening bussinesses and properties to create jobs and affordable housing. There are several other ways I want to help my community, like openning an art school</p>
