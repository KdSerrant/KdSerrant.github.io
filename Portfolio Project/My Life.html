<p>I was born in Ohio, and moved to North Carolina in my early teens. I always had an intrest in computers and videogames, but I have only recently felt like I am knowledgable on the topics. Im not surs what to put about my life other than things that I have enjoyed or have been inspired by. Some other things I like to do other than play video games and learn about electronics are guitar, crochet, and digital art. Out of the three, I'm better at crochet despite the fact that it was the last of my hobbies that I learned to do. I have no specific person that inspires me, but I like people that try to push the limits to things and that try to create new things out of old.
