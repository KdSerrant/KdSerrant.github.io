Home Page
The home page will have simple key information about myself, including my name, school, and the line of work I want to get into, and it will have a bit of information about the other website pages. This will have at least a picture of myself, and other visuals




My goals
This will be listed first other than the home page. It will show what degree I am working towards, the field of work I plan to work in, and other big goals that I want to do long term. This page will have many images to visualize these goals. It might also have a video or some outsourced content attached to it.


My life
This page will have more information about myself and background, I will add a picture, maybe one of myself, that features something about my background. It will be about 3 paragraphs minimum.


Ways to reach me
This will be a brief page with my contacts: email, phone number
It will be set up as the last page thanking the website users for checking out the website.
